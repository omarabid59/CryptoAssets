# CryptoAssets
Are you constantly calculating the total monetary value of all your crypto-assets? This script uses API calls to calculate the values of your ETH, BTC, BTG and BCH currencies automatically by using the current market price listed on QuadrigaCX.

This script only works for QuadrigaCX exchange at the moment. If you would like support for other exchanges, please let me know.



# USAGE

 1. Go to KEYS.txt and update your keys from Localbitcoin and QuadrigaCX.
 2. If you don't already have these please generate them.
 3. Remember, these keys are PRIVATE. Do not share them with anyone.
 4. Open up a terminal and enter this command
```
> python list_crypto_assets.py
```
You should see something like this returned back to you:
```
> BTG: 168.8037184($320.00/BTG)
> BTC: 7484.69591($18299.99/BTC)
> ETH: 2405.69606648($938.00/ETH)
> BCH: 361.839919163($3266.22/BCH)
> Total: 10421.035614
```

# BONUS
This script was originally used to automate the process of buying bitcoins from QuadrigaCX and selling them on Localbitcoins to generate a nice profit. If you are interested in trading see my other project [here](https://github.com/omarabid59/Bitcoin_LBTC_Trading).
